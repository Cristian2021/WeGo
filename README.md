# WeGo
2018 WIT Hackathon

'WeGo' is a mobile application that incentivises a healthy lifestyle among users. Using this app, users are able to receive a discount from participating point of interests in exchange for walking/running to the location. The application works by prompting a routed path to a suggested point of interest on the supplied map and using the device's accelerometer and location services to verify the user's activity. Once the user reaches their destination, they will receive a discount from the store. The business model for this service works off the premise of offering discounts to customers in exchange for increased customers. The main features of the app include leaderboards and invite screens ideal for meet ups, as well as 'missions' which further incentivise a healthy lifestyle.
